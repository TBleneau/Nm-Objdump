# Nm-Objdump
ELF exploration

The programs must work with the following:  

	• relocatable files .o & .a
	• shared files .so
	• executable files  

The goal of this project is to code a my_nm program with the exact same beahaviour
as the nm system command, and an my_objdump program with the exact same behaviour
as the objdump -f -s system command.
